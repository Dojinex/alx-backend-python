# 0x02. Python - Async Comprehension
## Asynchronous Generators and Async Comprehensions in Python
Asynchronous programming in Python allows you to write concurrent code that performs multiple tasks seemingly simultaneously. Asynchronous generators and async comprehensions are two powerful features introduced in Python to facilitate asynchronous programming.

## Asynchronous Generators
An asynchronous generator is a special type of iterator that produces a sequence of values asynchronously. It combines the concepts of asynchronous programming and generators. To create an asynchronous generator, you use the async def syntax and the yield statement inside an asynchronous function.

How to Write an Asynchronous Generator
python
```
import asyncio

async def async_generator():
    for i in range(5):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate asynchronous operation
        yield i
In this example, the async_generator function produces values asynchronously using await and yield.
```

## How to Use Asynchronous Generators
python
```
async def main():
    async for value in async_generator():
        print(value)

# Run the event loop
asyncio.run(main())
```

In this code, the async for loop is used to iterate over the values produced by the asynchronous generator.

## Async Comprehensions
Async comprehensions provide a concise syntax for creating asynchronous sequences, similar to list comprehensions but in an asynchronous context.

## How to Use Async Comprehensions
python

```
import asyncio

async def coro(i):
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return i * 2

async def main():
    results = [await coro(i) for i in range(5)]
    print(results)

# Run the event loop
asyncio.run(main())
In this example, async comprehensions are used to create a list of results from asynchronous coroutines.
```

## Type Annotations for Generators
Type annotations improve code readability and provide information about the expected types of values produced by the generator. For asynchronous generators, you can use AsyncGenerator from the typing module.

## How to Type-Annotate Asynchronous Generators
python
```
from typing import AsyncGenerator

async def async_generator() -> AsyncGenerator[int, None]:
    for i in range(5):
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate asynchronous operation
        yield i
```

In this example, AsyncGenerator[int, None] indicates that the asynchronous generator yields integers and does not return any value.

## How to Run the Examples
To run the examples in this repository, make sure you have Python 3.6 or above installed. Clone this repository and execute the Python files containing the examples.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/async-generators-and-comprehensions.git
cd async-generators-and-comprehensions
python async_generators_example.py
python async_comprehensions_example.py
